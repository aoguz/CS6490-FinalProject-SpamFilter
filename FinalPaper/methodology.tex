\section{Methodology}
The project was implemented entirely in Python and can be found in a public Github \cite{projectCode}. For machine learning, the sklearn library \cite{sklearn} was used. This library supports numerous machine learning algorithms. We chose to use the Enron Email Dataset \cite{enron} for both our training and test set. We selected 12,000 spam emails and 12,000 ham emails from this set for training and testing.
