\section{Related Work}
In the past, there have been many spam filtering solutions proposed. The support vector machine (SVM) is a common approach. Support Vector Machines were introduced  by Drucker, Wu, and Vapnik \cite{svm}. The researchers experimented using SVM with decision tree boosters for binary representations, and the results were satisfying.
Impressive results are reported using a word set with 3000 characters. After using iteration techniques, researchers found out that increasing the number of iterations increases the accuracy \cite{sculley2007relaxed}. One of the most famous spam filtering applications, ``SpamAssassin'', is currently using SVM to identify spam e-mails.
