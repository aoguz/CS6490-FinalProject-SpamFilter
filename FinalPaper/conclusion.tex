\section{Conclusion}
Using the Enron dataset, we were able to successfully categorize emails into spam and non-spam with a high amount of accuracy. Our regular expression-based feature selection allowed us to avoid overfitting and categorize spam more effectively.  From our results, we can conclude that AdaBoost is the most accurate spam filtering algorithm of those we tested.

In the future, we would like to explore the possiblilties of using our spam filtering algorithm on a production email server. The Enron dataset, while large, is quite old, and the nature of spam has changed significantly since 2001 (when Enron went bankrupt). We assume that the features needed to properly categorize modern spam will be different from those needed on this dataset due to new types of spam emails and increasing email complexity. Our analysis of algorithm performance would be more relevant if it included performance on modern data, a project that we leave to future work.
